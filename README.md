# Tetris

## Description

Tetris is a classic puzzle game where the player manipulates falling tetrominoes, geometric shapes composed of four square blocks, as they descend into a grid-based playfield. The objective is to create horizontal lines without any gaps, which causes the line to disappear and awards points. As the game progresses, the tetrominoes fall faster, challenging the player's speed and strategic planning.
